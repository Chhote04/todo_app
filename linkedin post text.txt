🚀 Just Launched My Own ToDo App! 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest project – a simple ToDo app that empowers me to add, complete, and delete tasks effortlessly, keeping my day organized and boosting productivity.

📝 Features:
✅ Add new tasks: With a user-friendly input box, I can easily add new tasks to my list. The app ensures that I can't add empty tasks, prompting me with an alert if I forget to write something.

✅ Complete tasks: To stay on top of my progress, I can mark tasks as completed by clicking on them. The app highlights completed tasks, making it easy for me to see what's already done.

✅ Delete tasks: If I no longer need a task, a simple click on the "x" symbol removes it from my list. This allows me to declutter and focus on my top priorities.

🎨 Design and User Interface:
I've put effort into creating a clean and intuitive design for the app. It's essential for me to have a seamless user experience, and I believe the minimalist interface accomplishes just that.

🧠 JavaScript Magic:
To make this app functional and dynamic, I leveraged the power of JavaScript. With DOM manipulation, I could add new tasks, handle task completion, and deletion seamlessly.

💾 Data Persistence:
I wanted my tasks to persist across sessions, so I implemented local storage to save and load tasks from the user's browser. This ensures that I won't lose my tasks when I close the app or refresh the page.
